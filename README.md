## KiparysikBot!

## Created using:
- Maven,
- Java 17,
- Spring boot.


## Description

This bot was created to make life easier for some people.
And of course, to demonstrate the skills of working with Spring boot and Telegram API. 
At the moment, testing is underway with an experienced focus group (my friends).


## Functionality

- Telling a great joke.
- Offers a random movie to watch or allows the user to watch a movie of interest on demand.
- Shows the weather.
- Shows the alerts map.
- Yes, it would be cool to add up-to-date information on turning off the electricity here. 
  But, let's be honest, "up-to-date" information is nowhere to be found now.
